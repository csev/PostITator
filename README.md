StickyGrader
------------

This is a simple JavaScript library that allows an annotation layer to be
placed over top of some HTML page.

The current example is rendering a PDF in the browser PDF.JS, with a custom
sticky note library adapted from a CodePen from edmondko
and a simple PHP based storage layer that uses PHP sessions.

You can see a demonstration of this in action at
